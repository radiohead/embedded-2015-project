  p Hello!
  p Iâ€™m nameless project made by two MSc students - Igor Suleymanov and Elena Bondarenko.
  p
  i What do I do?
  p I collect data from temperature and pressure sensors, store them in Redis and provide a user interface to browse through the data on my fancy pages.

  p I was built up using:
  ul
    li Hardware:
      ul
        li Raspberry Pi model B
        li Element14 MEMS Sensor Evaluation Board
    li Software:
      ul
        li Raspbian OS
        li Redis (open source, BSD licensed, advanced key-value cache and store)
        li Python-compatible C library for talking to sensors
        li Python daemon to collect data from sensors and store it in Redis
